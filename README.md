# D3-Challenge

The D3-Challenge repository contains these files:

	* assets directory which contains the style.css, data.csv, and app.json files
	* index html file (prebuilt)
	
This repo contains code to build a responsive website to explore the U.S. Census Bureau dataset, data.csv, which includes data on rates of 
income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 

The steps for building app.json are shown below.

	1. Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables `Healthcare vs. Poverty` using D3
	
	2. Using D3 techniques, the data points are represented by each state with circle elements
	
	3. Include state abbreviations in the circles
	
	4. Create and situate the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart
	
	5. This code is written in a function called makeResponsive that will resize the chart whenever the window is resized
